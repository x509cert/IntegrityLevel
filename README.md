# IntegrityLevel

Bare bones code sample that demonstrates how to spin up a process in Windows at a lower integrity level. This is the same type of tactic used by Edge/Chrome/IE/Office/Acrobat - processes handing dodgy are constrained so minimize damage if a process blows up while parsing untrusted data.
